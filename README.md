# MCMC_Sampler
Short description: Bayesian Inference - Implementation of an MCMC sampler

This was a project for a class on Bayesian Deep Learning as part of my Master's program. The sceleton was provided by the professor.
Tne functions where points are awarded are the functions I have implemented.
